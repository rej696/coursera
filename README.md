		2. Agile Software Development: 12 hrs
		3. Lean Software Development: 10 hrs
    4. Engineering Practices for Building Quality Software: 18 hrs

## A.I. and Machine Learning
- Several Courses available, Deep learning course flows into Tensorflow course. But both may be supported by mathematics for machine learning course.
- [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
  - 4 months at 5 hrs/week: 80 hrs
  - Included with Capgemini Coursera Subscription
    1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning: 20 hrs
